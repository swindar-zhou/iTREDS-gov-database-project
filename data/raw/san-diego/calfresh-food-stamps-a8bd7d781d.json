Eligibility to CalFresh\n and the amount of benefits a household may receive depends on the\n household's size, income, and expenses.\nCalFresh benefits are provided on an Electronic Benefit Transfer\n (EBT) card and can be used to buy food at participating grocery\n stores, online stores, and farmers markets.\nExpand All\n|\nCollapse All\nIn need of food right away?\nApply for CalFresh\nand you may\r\n be eligible to receive benefits in as few as 3 days. You can also get\r\n food by visiting\nSan Diego Food Bank\n,\nFeeding San Diego\n, or\r\n calling\n211 San Diego\n.\nLearn how SUN Bucks can help you buy food for your children\nSUN\r\n Bucks\n, also known as Summer EBT, is a new program to help families\r\n buy food for their school-aged children while on summer break. You do\r\n not need to apply for SUN Bucks if your household is receiving\r\n CalFresh.  Each school-aged child in your household will receive a SUN\r\n Bucks EBT card loaded with $120 in benefits to purchase food. Children\r\n who get SUN Bucks can still participate in other summer meals programs.\nHow to Apply\nEligibility Requirements\nElectronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Card\nBenefits\nApplication Process Tips\nCalFresh Program Guide\nCalFresh Retailer Locator\nRestaurant Meals Program\nReplacement Benefits\nCommunity Resources & Self-Help\nFamily Resource Centers\nAdditional Resources\nFAQs\nThis institution is an equal opportunity provider.\nNondiscrimination Statement\nAviso\n de No Discriminación\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook!\nYour\n Opinion Counts\nCommunity\n Partner Resource Toolkit\nSend Documents with LaterDocs!\nFile Your Tax Returns!\nDid you know?\n/\n¿Sabias Que?\nWorkplace Rights\n Information & Resources\nPopular Services\nAging & Independence Services\nBehavioral Health Services\nChildren's Services\nHousing & Community Development Services\nMedical Care Services\nPublic Health Services\nSelf-Sufficiency Programs\nSupport Divisions\nFind an office near you\nMore Services\nMore Stories",
