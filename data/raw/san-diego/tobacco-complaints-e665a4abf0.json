All unincorporated areas follow the County of San Diego\n smoking ordinances.\nClick\n here if you live in a city without a smoke-free outdoor dining\n policy and want to learn how you can help.\nFor information on federal, state, and local tobacco laws and\n regulations; local law enforcement agencies in San Diego County; and\n frequently asked questions, see additional links at the bottom of\n the page.\nCalifornia's SB 793 Law Now Prohibits the Sale of Most Flavored\n Tobacco Products\nWhen did the law go into effect?\nThe law went into effect on December 21, 2022.\nWhich flavored tobacco products cannot be sold in California?\n• Flavored electronic cigarettes\n (e-cigarettes) that deliver a flavored e-liquid\n• Flavored e-liquids, even if they\n contain tobacco-free nicotine or do not contain any nicotine\n• Vape pens with flavored\n cannabidiol (CBD), aromatherapy, or essential oils\n• Menthol cigarettes\n• Flavored non-premium cigars,\n little cigars, and cigarillos\n• Flavored smokeless tobacco\n• Flavored blunt wraps and\n flavored hemp wraps\n• Flavored loose-leaf,\n roll-your-own tobacco\n• Flavor enhancers, such as\n e-liquid flavor enhancers or flavored cigarette papers.\nCan retailers sell flavored tobacco products that are already in\n their stores after the state law goes into effect?\nNo. There is no sell-down period.\nAre there penalties for selling flavored tobacco products?\nYes. Any retailer, their agents or employees will be fined\n $250 for each violation of the state law. Local         jurisdictions\n are responsible for enforcing the law. Jurisdictions that have adopted\n ordinances prohibiting the         sale of flavored tobacco products\n may assess higher penalties.\nAre there any exemptions?\nYes. State law exempts loose-leaf pipe tobacco, premium\n cigars with a wholesale price of $12 or more, and         shisha\n (hookah tobacco) when sold by a licensed store that only allows people\n 21 or older on the premises.         Some local jurisdictions do not\n exempt these products.\nWhat about local jurisdictions?\nChula Vista, San Diego, and the County of San Diego regulate\n flavored tobacco products in the same way the state does, but\n retailers in those jurisdictions may be subject to higher fines and\n penalties. Retailers located in the cities below must comply with\n additional restrictions on the sale of flavored tobacco products:\n• Encinitas exempts shisha, but state law now limits the\n sale of shisha to licensed, adult-only facilities.\n• Imperial Beach prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco\n products, no exemptions.\n• Solana Beach prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco\n products, no exemptions.\nHow can retailers safely dispose of e-cigarettes?\nE-cigarettes are hazardous waste and must be disposed of as follows:\nhttps://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/CTCB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Community/\nEducationalMaterials/DisposalofE-CigarettesPUBLIC.pdf.\nWhere can we find additional information or ask specific questions?\nThe California Department of Public Health has posted information on\n SB 793 here:\nhttps://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/CTCB/Pages/CAFlavorTobaccoLaw.aspx#.\nPlease visit the Tobacco Retail Licensing program’s website at:\nhttps://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/tobacco_control_resource_program/\ntobacco_sales_regulations.html\n,email us at\n TRLApplications.HHSA@sdcounty.ca.gov, or leave a message at\n 833-THE-TRLP (833-843-8757).\nTobacco Ordinances: Unincorporated Area of San Diego County\nOn January 28, 2020, the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors\n approved an ordinance (Ordinance No. 10647) to reduce the impacts of\n tobacco in the unincorporated area of San Diego County.

Additionally, smoking is\n prohibited within 40 feet from a permitted food facility that is a\n mobile food or temporary food facility, such as a food truck or food\n cart.\nOn December 8, 2020, the County of San Diego\n Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance (Ordinance No.\n 10699) creating a Tobacco Retail Licensing Program in the\n unincorporated area of San Diego County. Effective July 1,\n 2021:\nTobacco retailers must apply for and receive\n an annual County of San Diego Tobacco Retail License (TRL)\n to sell tobacco products.\nTobacco retailers should\n comply with all operating and tobacco product requirements\n of the Tobacco Retail Licensing Program.\nThe County of San Diego will begin receiving and processing TRL\n applications on June 1, 2021.\nClick below to learn more about what the ordinance means for\n tobacco retailers and dining establishments in the unincorporated\n area of the county.\nAdditional Resources\nTobacco control laws and regulations protect the health of the public\n and promote smoke-free environments.
