If you are not covered by your own or a family\n member's health plan, you must get insurance or pay a tax penalty\n called the \"shared responsibility payment\". Two important\n ways people can get insurance are through expanded Medi-Cal benefits\n or the state-operated marketplace called Covered California.\nExpanded Medi-Cal\nExpanded Medi-Cal will provide medical coverage to adults, ages\n 21-64. Individuals may qualify for expanded Medi-Cal if their Modified\n Adjusted Gross Income is less than 138 percent of the\nFederal Poverty Level\n(FPL).\nIf you do not qualify for Expanded Medi-Cal, you may qualify for\n other health coverage through\nCovered California\n.\nCovered California\nCovered California\nis the new state-run\n marketplace or exchange for individuals, families and small\n businesses. Visit the site to find out if you and your family might\n get financial assistance on a sliding scale to make coverage more\n affordable. You will be able to compare and choose health coverage\n that best fits your needs and budget. (\nCovered\n California en español\n)\nThe Covered California phone number is\n1-888-975-1142\n.\n2-1-1\n San Diego also has information on Covered California.\nVisit the website\nor dial 2-1-1 to speak\n with someone.\nCovered California produced the following\nvideo\nintroduction to the changes. (\nVideo en español\n)\nModified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)\nGenerally, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is the total\n of your adjusted gross income and tax-exempt interest income you may\n have. These are the amounts on lines 37 and 8b of IRS form 1040. Some\n examples of income are: wages, salaries, tips, taxable interest,\n certain dividends, business income, capital gains, and unemployment\n compensation, as well as annuities, Social Security payments and some pensions.\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook!\nYour\n Opinion Counts\nCommunity\n Partner Resource Toolkit\nSend Documents with LaterDocs!\nFile Your Tax Returns!\nDid you know?\n/\n¿Sabias Que?\nWorkplace Rights\n Information & Resources\nPopular Services\nAging & Independence Services\nBehavioral Health Services\nChildren's Services\nHousing & Community Development Services\nMedical Care Services\nPublic Health Services\nSelf-Sufficiency Programs\nSupport Divisions\nFind an office near you\nMore Services\nMore Stories",
